# GraalVM demos

This repository contains several small applications and benchmarks written in Java, JavaScript, Kotlin. These programs are illustrating capabilities of [GraalVM](http://graalvm.org)

## Running

Clone this repository. Every top level folder here contains a demo app and the instructions on how to run that particular code are in its README.md.

## Tested Compatibility

The demos are normal applications & benchmarks in Java, Kotlin, JavaScript and so on, so they are compatible with any virtual machine capable of running Java, JavaScript, and so on. You can run it on the stock JVM, node, etc.

However, these were tested and are known to work with:
* GraalVM-Version: 0.32
